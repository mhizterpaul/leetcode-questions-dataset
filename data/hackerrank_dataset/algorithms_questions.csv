https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/beadornaments?isFullScreen=true,"There are
colors of beads. You have
beads of the

Step #
Arrange all the beads in any order such that beads of the same color are placed together.
Step #
The ornament initially consists of only the first bead from the arrangement.
Step #
For each subsequent bead in order, join it to a bead of the same color in the ornament. If there is no bead of the same color, it can be joined to any bead in the ornament.
All beads are distinct, even if they have the same color. Two ornaments are considered different if two beads are joined by a thread in one configuration, but not in the other.  How many different ornaments can be formed using this algorithm? Return the answer modulo

Update/clarification
Think of the bead formation as a tree and not as a straight line. Any number of beads can be connected to a bead.
Example
There are two beads of color

Testcase 1:
Let us label the beads A1,A2 and B1. Initially, they can be arranged in
ways - ""A1,A2,B1"", ""A2,A1,B1"", ""B1,A1,A2"", and ""B1,A2,A1"".
For each of the first two arrangements, an ornament can be formed in
ways (A1-A2-B1 or B1-A1-A2 from the first one and A2-A1-B1 or B1-A2-A1 from the second one).
For each of the last two arrangements, an ornament can be formed in
way.
However, of the total
possible ornaments, there are only
unique ones : A1 - A2 - B1, and A2 - A1 - B1.
Testcase 2:
The possible unique ornaments are A1 - A2 - B1 - B2, A1 - A2 - B2 - B1, A2 - A1 - B1 - B2, and A2 - A1 - B2 - B1.
Testcase 3:
For the third test-case, it might be easier to see there are only
types of graphs on
vertices: the path or the star. It's not hard to see that there are
paths and
stars (explanation courtesy: zlangley)
Testcase 5:
For the fifth test-case, a lot of people claimed that the total number of possible ways is
. But that is wrong. The correct answer is
. Here's the hint: Once again, you've to think of it as a tree.
So one possible arrangement can be:
A is a root node and has two edges (A-B and A-C). Now, think of B as a sub-root node with two edges (B-D and B-E). Similarly, you can figure out the other possible bead arrangements. This will lead you to the correct answer.",

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/alex-vs-fedor?isFullScreen=true,"In order to entertain themselves during the long flight, Alex and Fedor invented the following very simple two players game. The game is:
First, Alex draws some graph with bidirectional weighted edges. There are possibly multiple edges (probably, with different or same weights) in this graph.
Then Fedor picks some spanning tree of this graph. If the tree appears to be the minimal spanning tree, then the winner is Fedor. Otherwise, the winner is Alex.
We consider two trees different if the sets of the numbers of edges that are included in these trees are different. We consider two sets
and
different if there is at least one element that is present in
and not present in
or vice versa.
We should also mention that the graphs with enormous number of spanning trees upset Alex, as well as Fedor, so they will never have a graph that has more than
spanning trees.
At some point, Fedor became too lazy to look for minimal spanning trees and now he just picks some arbitrary spanning tree from the Alex's graph. Each spanning tree has equal probability to be picked by Fedor. What is the probability of Fedor's victory now?
Input Format
The first line of input consists of two single space separated integers

According to the ancient Masters, a saint's power to control the cosmos strengthens, when one allows the energy of the universe to flow within the body and then concentrates it. This energy can even be used to explode the objects.
Today's training is based on a game, and the goal is to use as little cosmos as possible to win. Two saints play as follows:
Initially there are
piles of stones; pile
has
stone, pile
has
stones, and so on. Thus, the
pile has
stones. The saints take turns and in each turn, a saint must select a non-empty pile and destroy
at least half of the stones in it
. The winner is the saint who destroys the last available stone .
For example, from a pile of
stones, a saint must destroy at least
stones, leaving a single (and possibly empty) pile at most 3 stones. With such game, saints learn how to use the appropriate amount of cosmos in a single strike: too much will destroy more stones than desired, too little won't be enough. They also improve their battle thinking and strategy skills.
Ryuho suspects that such game is not as random as it appears to be at first glance. He strongly believes that with the correct single blow, you're assured to win from the very first turn, if you play optimally, no matter how good the other saint plays. Moreover, he is particularly interested in knowing the minimum number of stones he needs to destroy at that first move. Can you help him?

and
.
Initially Ryuho will remove
stone from the first pile.
Now other saint has
options -
First, to remove all stones from second pile. In that case Ryuho will remove all stones from third pile and win the game.
Second, to remove all stones from third pile. In that case Ryuho will remove all stones from second pile and win the game.
Third, to remove
stone from second pile. In that case Ryuho will remove
stones from third pile and they will be left with
stone in each of the second and third pile. No matter what the other saint selects Ryuho will have an option to select the last stone.
Fourth, to remove
stones from the third pile. In that case Ryuho will remove
stone from second pile and they will be left with
stone in each of the second and third pile. No matter what the other saint selects Ryuho will have an option to select the last stone.
So in all four cases Ryuho will win the game.",

On refueling 2 gallon of fuel at city 2, he then travels back to city 0 by using 2 gallons of fuel.
Here is the second possible solution.
Steven starts from city 2, fill his car with 2 gallons, and travels to city 0.
On refueling 3 gallons of fuel from city 0, he then travels to city 1, and exhausts 2 gallons of fuel. His fuel tank contains 1 gallon of fuel now.
He can then refuel 1 gallon of fuel at City 1, and increase his car's fuel to 2 gallons and travel to city 2.
However, Steven cannot start from city 1, because he is given only 1 gallon of fuel, but travelling to city 2 requires 2 gallons.

We play the following
games:
In the first game,
abcdefghij
is already as lexicographically small as possible (each sequential letter is in alphabetical order). Because we don't need to perform any moves, we print
on a new line.
In the second game, we rotate the suffix starting at index
, so
a
cab
becomes
a
abc
.
Because the string is lexicographically smallest after one move, we print
on a new line.
In the third game, we perform the following moves:
Rotate the suffix starting at index
(i.e., the entire string), so
baba
becomes
abab
.
Rotate the suffix starting at index

a

Because the string is lexicographically smallest after two moves, we print

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/episode-recording?isFullScreen=true,"Dave is a die-hard fan of a show called ""HackerRank"", in which a young programmer uses her problem-solving abilities to solve crimes. He splurged on a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) so that he can record HackerRank episodes and watch them later. Luckily, Dave managed to get his hands on schedules for all the episodes in each upcoming season.
Each season has
episodes numbered from
to
. Each episode airs twice; the first time it's called ""live"", and the second time it's called ""repeat"". So, for each episode, we have
integers,
and
for the live airing and
and
for the repeat airing, where
is episode's start time and and
is its end time. All times are given as integers representing the number of minutes passed since the start of the season.
Episodes broadcast on multiple channels, so some of the air times overlap and the episodes may not broadcast sequentially. It's possible that both the live and repeat broadcasts of some episode
are held before episode
, even though
. In addition, live and repeat broadcasts of the same episode may differ in length due to the number of advertisements during the broadcast.
Dave only has one TV with a DVR attached to it, and the DVR is capable of recording one episode at a time. For each episode in a season, Dave first decides whether or not he will record it. If he decides to record it, he will either record it during
or
. Dave will only ever record one of the two airings of an episode, and he always records
full
episodes. This means that once he starts recording an episode, he will always record it until the end (i.e., he never records partial episodes).
Dave realizes that it might not be possible for him to record all episodes successfully, so instead of focusing on recording all episodes of HackerRank (which may be impossible), he decides to record all consecutively airing episodes whose episode number occurs in some inclusive
interval such that
(i.e., the number of consecutive episodes recorded) is as large as possible.
Given the programming schedule for each season, find
and
episode numbers for largest range of consecutive episodes Dave can record during that season and print these respective values as two space-separated integers on a new line. If two or more such intervals exist, choose the one having the smallest
value.
Input Format
The first line contains a single positive integer,
, denoting number of seasons of HackerRank.
The subsequent lines describe each of the
seasons in the following format:
The first line contains an integer,
, denoting the number of episodes in the season.

For the third season, Dave must choose to record either episode

starts while episode

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bowling-pins?isFullScreen=true,"Bowling is a sport in which a player rolls a bowling ball towards a group of pins, the target being to knock down the pins at the end of a lane.
In this challenge, the rules of the game are slightly modified. Now, there are a given number of pins, and the pins are arranged in a horizontal line instead of a triangular formation. Two players have to play this game, taking alternate turns. Whoever knocks down the last pin(s) will be declared the winner.
You are playing this game with your friend, and both of you have become proficient at it. You can knock down any single pin, or any two adjacent pins at one throw of a bowling ball, however, these are the only moves that you can perform. Some moves have already been played. Suddenly, you realize that it is possible to determine whether this game can be won or not, assuming optimal play. And luckily it's your turn right now.
A configuration is represented by a string consisting of the letters
X
and
I
, where:
I
represents a position containing a pin.
X
represents a position where a pin has been knocked down.
An example of such a configuration is shown in the image below. Here, the number of pins is

pin has already been knocked down.

Note
A player has to knock down at least one pin in his turn.
Both players play optimally.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer,

Test Case 1:
As the
pins are not adjacent, they can't be knocked down in a single turn. Therefore, you can only knock down one of the two pins. Then, in the next turn, your friend will knock down the last pin.
Test Case 2:
You can knock down both pins in a single turn.
Test Case 3:
You can knock down one or two pins from either side. Your friend can just copy your move on the other side and will be able to get the last move, hence win the game.
Test Case 4:
You can knock the middle pin, thus resulting in the configuration

We can cover 6 nodes of this graph with these two crabs: One of the crabs has 4 as its head and 1 and 3 as its feet, the other crab has 5 as its head and 7 and 8 as its feet. No additional crabs can be added.
The above is not a unique solution: any combination of two crabs, with one head at 4 and one head at 5, will suffice. We could have also chosen Head[4]feet[1,2] and Head[5]feet[6,7] as our two crabs.

Each line begins with

I've attached a figure here to explain the sample test case.
You can verify the first building's specifications with the figure.
(Total number of persons in the first building), followed by 1 1 1 4 10(Floor numbers).
floor = 3 persons.
floor = 1 person.
floor = 1 person.
Similarly, the specifications for the other three buildings follow.
The connected line shows the path which Superman can use to save the maximum number of people. In this case, that number is

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/zero-move-nim?isFullScreen=true,"Nim
is a famous game in which two players take turns removing items from
distinct piles. During each turn, a player must remove one or more items from a single, non-empty pile. The winner of the game is whichever player
removes the last item from the last non-empty pile
.
John and Kate modified Nim by adding the following rule, which they call a
Zero-Move
:
For each
non-empty
pile, either player can remove
items from that pile and have it count as their move; however, this move can only be performed
once per pile by either player
. For example, let's say pile
initially has
items in it. If John decides to use a Zero-Move on pile
, then neither John nor Kate can perform another Zero-Move on pile
; that said, either player is free to perform a Zero-Move on any other non-empty pile that hasn't had a Zero-Move performed on it yet.
John and Kate play
games of
Zero-Move Nim
. Given the number of items in each pile for each game, determine whether or not John can win the game if he always moves first and each player always moves optimally (i.e., never makes a move that causes them to lose if some better, winning move exists). For each game, print
W

John and Kate play the following
games:
We have two piles,
and
. John removes
item from
, so
. Now that there is only
item in each pile, gameplay can proceed in either of the following ways:
Kate removes the last object from one pile, then John removes the last object from the other pile.
Kate uses a Zero-Move on one of the piles, and John uses a Zero-Move on the other pile. Next, Kate must take the last object from one pile, at which point John removes the last object from the other pile.
Because John always wins in either scenario, we print
W
on a new line.
John cannot win this game because the two piles are of equal size and Kate has an opportunity to counter any move he makes by performing the same action. Consider the following scenarios:
If John uses a Zero-Move on one pile, Kate can use a Zero-Move on the other pile (meaning the piles still have the same configuration after both players move).
If John removes one element from a pile, Kate can remove one element from the other pile so that both remaining piles contain one element when John takes his next turn. He would then be forced to empty one of the piles, leaving Kate to make the winning move by emptying the last pile.
If John removes both elements from one of the piles, Kate can remove both elements from the other pile and win the game.
Because John always loses this game, we print

Now, we have two people knowing the

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/missile-defend?isFullScreen=true,"Update:
A slight modification in the problem statement (see below)
Evil Nation A is angry and plans to launch
N
guided-missiles at the peaceful Nation B in an attempt to wipe out all of Nation B's people. Nation A's missile
i
will arrive in nation B at time t
i
. Missile
i
communicates with its headquarters by unique radio signals with a frequency equal to f
i
. Can you help the peaceful Nation B survive by building a defensive system that will stop the missiles dead in the sky?
Defensive system:
The only way to defend Nation B from the attacking missile is by counter attacking them with a
hackerX
missile. You have a lot of
hackerX
missiles and each one of them has its own radio frequency. An individual
hackerX
missile can destroy Evil Nation A’s attacking missile if the radio frequency of both of the missiles match. Each
hackerX
missile can be used an indefinite number of times. Its invincible and doesn't get destroyed in the collision.
The good news is you can adjust the frequency of the
hackerX
missile to match the evil missiles' frequency. When changing the
hackerX
missile's initial frequency fA to the new defending frequency fB, you will need \|fB - fA\| units of time to do.
Each
hackerX
missile can only destroy one of Nation A's missile at a time. So if two evil missiles with same frequency arrive at the same time, you need at least two
hackerX
missiles with the same frequency as the evil missiles to avoid damage.
If two evil missles with same frequency arrive at the same time, we can destroy them both with one
hackerX
missile. You can set the frequency of a
hackerX
missile to any value when its fired.
What is the minimum number of
hackerX
missiles you must launch to keep Nation B safe?
Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer
N
denoting the number of missiles.
This is followed by
N
lines each containing two integers t
i
and f
i
denoting the time & frequency of the i
th
missile.

A single integer denoting the minimum number of
hackerX

missile is launched at t = 1 with a frequency f = 1, and destroys the first missile. It re-tunes its frequency to f = 2 in 1 unit of time, and destroys the missile that is going to hit Nation B at t = 2. It re-tunes its frequency back to 1 in 1 unit of time and destroys the missile that is going to hit the nation at t = 3. It is relaunched at t = 5 with f = 1 and destroys the missile that is going to hit nation B at t = 5. Hence, you need only 1

The first hackerX missile can destroy the 3rd missile which has the same frequency as itself. The same hackerX missile destroys the missile that is hitting its city at t = 5.

Fedor is a research scientist, who has recently found a road map of Ancient Berland.
Ancient Berland consisted of
N
cities that were connected by
M
bidirectional roads. The road builders weren't knowledgable. Hence, the start city and the end city for each road were always chosen
randomly and independently
. As a result, there were more than one road between some pairs of cities. Nevertheless, by luck, the country remained connected (i.e. you were able to get from one city to another via these
M
roads). And for any road, the start and the end city were not the same.
Moreover, each road had it's own
value of importance
. This value was assigned by the Road Minister of Ancient Berland. The Road Minister also was not knowledgable, so these numbers were assigned to the roads
randomly and independently
from the other roads.
When there was a war with the neighboring countries (usually it was with Ancient Herland), it was important to estimate
separation number
for some pairs of cities.

For simplicity, proteins are called

A   B   C   D
    _   _   _   _
A|  A   B   C   D
B|  B   A   D   C
C|  C   D   A   B
D|  D   C   B   A
Here rows denote the protein at current position, while columns denote the protein at the next position. And the corresponding value in the table denotes the new protein that will emerge. So for example,
if protein i is A, and protein i + 1 is B, protein i will change to B
. All mutations take place simultaneously. The protein ring is seen as a circular list, so last protein of the list mutates depending on the first protein.
Using this data, they have written a small simulation software to get mutations second by second. The problem is that the protein rings can be very long (up to 1 million proteins in a single ring) and they want to know the state of the ring after upto
seconds. Thus their software takes too long to report the  results. They ask you for your help.

Stockfish
and
Komodo
to help us analyze games. These engines are very powerful pieces of well-developed software that use intelligent ideas and algorithms to analyze positions and sequences of moves, as well as to find tactical ideas. Consider the following simplified version of chess:
Board
:
It's played on a
board between two players named
Black
and
White
.
Rows are numbered from
to
, where the top row is
and the bottom row is
.
Columns are lettered from
to
, where the leftmost column is
and the rightmost column is
.
Pieces and Movement
:
White
initially has
pieces and
Black
initially has
pieces.
There are no Kings on the board. Each player initially has exactly
Queen,
at most
Pawns,
at most
Rooks, and
at most
minor pieces (i.e., a Bishop and/or Knight).
White
's Pawns move
up
the board, while
Black
's Pawns move
down
the board.
Each move made by any player counts as a single move.
Each piece's possible moves are the same as in
classical chess
, with the following exceptions:
Pawns
cannot
move two squares forward.
The
en passant
move is not possible.
Promotion
:
Pawns promote to either a Bishop, Knight, or Rook when they reach the back row (promotion to a Queen is not allowed).
The players
must
perform promotions whenever possible. This means
White
must promote their Pawns when they reach any cell in the top row, and
Black
must promote their Pawns when they reach any cell in the bottom row.
Objective
:
The goal of the game is to capture the opponent’s Queen without losing your own.
There will never be a draw or tie scenario like you might see in classical chess.
Given
and the layout of pieces for
games, implement a very basic engine for our simplified version of chess that determines whether or not
White
can win in
moves (regardless of how
Black
plays) if
White
always moves first. For each game, print
YES

White

The
subsequent lines describe each chess piece in the form
t c r
, where
is a character
denoting the type of piece (where
is Queen,
is Knight,
is Bishop,
is Rook, and
is a Pawn), and

Explanation
Karl makes three passes:
In the first pass, he makes
candies. He then spends
of them hiring another worker, so
and he has one candy left over.
In the second pass, he makes
candies. He spends
of them on another machine and another worker, so
and
and he has
candies left over.
In the third pass, Karl makes
candies. Because this satisfies his goal of making at least
candies, we print the number of passes (i.e.,
) as our answer.",

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fighting-pits?isFullScreen=true,"Meereen is famous for its fighting pits where fighters fight each other to the death.
Initially, there are
fighters and each fighter has a strength value. The
fighters are divided into
teams, and each fighter belongs exactly one team. For each fight, the Great Masters of Meereen choose two teams,
and
, that must fight each other to the death. The teams attack each other in alternating turns, with team
always launching the first attack. The fight ends when all the fighters on one of the teams are dead.
Assume each team always attacks optimally. Each attack is performed as follows:
The attacking team chooses a fighter from their team with strength
.
The chosen fighter chooses
at most
fighters from other team and kills all of them.
The Great Masters don't want to see their favorite fighters fall in battle, so they want to build their teams carefully and know who will win different team matchups. They want you to perform two type of queries:
1 p x
Add a new fighter with strength
to team
. It is guaranteed that this new fighter's strength value will not be less than any current member of team

2 x y
Print the name of the team that would win a matchup between teams
and
in their current state (recall that team

Given the initial configuration of the teams and
queries, perform each query so the Great Masters can plan the next fight.
Note:
You are determining the team that
would
be the winner if the two teams fought. No fighters are actually dying in these matchups so, once added to a team, a fighter is available for all future potential matchups.
Input Format
The first line contains three space-separated integers describing the respective values of
(the number of fighters),
(the number of teams), and
(the number of queries).
Each line

Explanation
The first task alone can be completed in 2 minutes, and so you won't overshoot the deadline.
With the first two tasks, the optimal schedule can be:
time 1: task 2
time 2: task 1
time 3: task 1
We've overshot task 1 by 1 minute, hence returning 1.
With the first three tasks, the optimal schedule can be:
time 1 : task 2
time 2 : task 1
time 3 : task 3
time 4 : task 1
time 5 : task 3
time 6 : task 3
Task 1 has a deadline 2, and it finishes at time 4. So it exceeds its deadline by 2.
Task 2 has a deadline 1, and it finishes at time 1. So it exceeds its deadline by 0.
Task 3 has a deadline 4, and it finishes at time 6. So it exceeds its deadline by 2.
Thus, the maximum time by which you overshoot a deadline is 2. No schedule can do better than this.
Similar calculation can be done for the case containing 5 tasks.",

Tom and Derpina have a rectangular shaped chocolate bar with chocolates labeled T, D and U. They want to split the bar into exactly two pieces such that:
Tom's piece can not contain any chocolate labeled D and similarly, Derpina's piece can not contain any chocolate labeled T and U can be used by either of the two.
All chocolates in each piece must be connected (two chocolates are connected if they share an edge), i.e. the chocolates should form one connected component
The absolute difference between the number of chocolates in pieces should be at most K
After dividing it into exactly two pieces, in any piece, there should not be 4 adjacent chocolates that form a square, i.e. there should not be a fragment like this:

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/move-the-coins?isFullScreen=true,"Alice and Bob are playing a game, defined below:
There is an undirected tree graph with
nodes that has the following properties:
Each node has
golden coins.
Node

Moves
Players move in turns.
During a move, a player can select a node
and move one or more coins to
.
If the current player can't make any move, they lose the game.
The game quickly becomes boring because the result is determined by the tree's configuration and the number of coins in each node (assuming that both players play optimally).
Alice decides to instead challenge Bob by asking him
questions. For each question
:
Alice picks a node
and
removes
the edge between
and
.
She picks another node
and draws a new undirected edge between
and
. So now
.
Bob must determine if the first player has a winning strategy for the new tree or not. It's possible that after Alice draws the new edge, the graph will no longer be a tree; if that happens, the question is
invalid
. Each question is independent, so the answer depends on the initial state of the graph (and not on previous questions).
Given the tree and the number of coins in each node, can you help Bob answer all
questions?
Input Format
The first line contains an integer,

The second line contains
space-separated integers,

Nikita's mischievous little brother erased some of the edges and all of the coloring from her graph! As a result, the graph is now decomposed into one or more components. Because you're her best friend, you've decided to help her reconstruct the graph by adding
edges such that the aforementioned graph properties hold true.
Given the decomposed graph, construct and shade a valid connected graph such that the difference
between its shaded nodes is minimal.

Ma5termind usually finishes all the levels of a game very fast. But, This time however he got stuck at the very first level of this new game. Can you help him play this game.
To finish the game, Ma5termind has to cross
levels. At each level of the game, Ma5termind has to face
enemies. Each enemy has its associated power
and some number of bullets
. To knock down an enemy, Ma5termind needs to shoot him with one or multiple bullets whose collective count is equal to the power of the enemy. If Ma5termind manages to knock down any one enemy at a level, the rest of them run away and the level is cleared.
Here comes the challenging part of the game.
Ma5termind acquires all the bullets of an enemy once he has knocked him down. Ma5termind can use the bullets acquired after killing an enemy at
level only till the
level.
However, the bullets Ma5termind carried before the start of the game can be taken forward and can be used to kill more enemies.
Now, Ma5termind has to guess the minimum number of bullets he must have before the start of the game so that he clears all the

For the First test case , Ma5termind kills the enemy in the following order:
Ma5termind kills the
enemy at the

Ma5termind kills the
enemy at the
level, takes all his bullets and moves to the next level.
Ma5termind kills the
enemy at the
level, takes all his bullets and moves to the next level.
So this way Ma5termind can successfully finish this game with only
bullet in hand before the start of the game.
For the second test case , Ma5termind kills the enemy in the following order:
Ma5termind kills the
enemy at the
level, takes all his bullets and moves to the next level.
Ma5termind kills the
enemy at the

Ma5termind kills the

So this way Ma5termind can successfully finish this game with only

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/vertical-rooks?isFullScreen=true,"HackerChess is a variant of chess played at HackerRank. It is a game played between two players who make moves in turns until one of them cannot make any move. The player who cannot make a move loses the game and the other player is declared the winner. The game is played on a board with
rows and
columns. The only pieces used in the game are rooks. A rook in HackerChess moves only vertically, which means that in never leaves a column to which it belongs. Moreover, in a single move, a rook moves through any number of unoccupied cells. Notice that there are no captures in HackerChess, two rooks cannot occupy the same cell, and a rook cannot jump over another rook. Each player has exactly one rook in each of the
columns of the board.
Given the initial position of the rooks and knowing that the second player makes the first move, decide who will win the game if both players play optimally.
Input Format
In the first line, there is a single integer
denoting the number of games to be played. After that, descriptions of

Explanation 0
There is only one game player in the sample input. The game is played on the board with
rows and
columns. Let's denote the first player's rooks as red rooks and the second player's rooks as green ones. Then the initial position of the game looks like this:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1497441833-dfbf8fbc16-initial.jpg
The second player moves first and he can move his rook in the first column to the second row. After this move, the position looks as follows:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1497441866-e3a6c5d9f0-1.jpg
Next, it is the first player's turn. He cannot make any move with his rook in the first column, so he has to make a move in the second or the third column. Without the loss of generality, let's assume that he makes a move in the second column. He can only make one such move, i.e. move the rook from the second to the third row. This results in the following position:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1497441899-0ed71c73ec-2.jpg
After that, the best move for the second player is to move his rook in the second column from the first to the second row. After this move, the position looks like this:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1497441914-91e26a4441-3.jpg
Next, it is again the first player's move. The only move he can make is to move his rook in the third column from the second to the third row. It results in the following position:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1497441924-0c9b8aaab7-4.jpg
Then, the best move for the second player is to move his rook in the third column from the first to the second row. After that, the position looks as follows:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1497441935-5530dae1e5-5.jpg
Next, it is the first player's move, but since he is unable to make any valid move, he loses and the second player is declared a winner.
It shows that regardless of the first player's moves, the second player has a strategy leading to his victory.

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/2s-complement?isFullScreen=true,"Understanding
's complement
representation is fundamental to learning about Computer Science. It allows us to write negative numbers in binary.  The leftmost digit is used as a sign bit.  If it is
, we have a negative number and it is represented as the two's complement of its absolute value.  Let's say you wrote down the
's complement representation for each
-bit integer in the inclusive range from
to
.  How many
's would you write down in all?
For example, using an
-bit byte rather than
bit integer, the two's complement of a number can be found by reversing all its bits and adding
.  The two's complement representations for a few numbers are shown below:
|Number|                Representation in
Number   Binary     Inverse     Two's Complement
-3      00000011    11111100    11111101
-2      00000010    11111101    11111110

To write down that range of numbers' two's complements in
bits, we wrote
's.  Remember to use
bits rather than

Client
will be interested in house
because it has more than
units of space and costs less than

Client
will be interested in house
because it has more than

Two players are playing this game optimally. That means that if a player has a move that leads to his/her victory, he/she will definitely use this move. If a player is unable to make a move, he loses.

There are no Kings and no Pawns on the board. Each player has exactly
one
Queen, at most
two
Rooks, and at most

The first character is 'a', the set is {a} hence 1.
The first 2 characters are 'ab', the set is {a, b, ab} but 'a' is pseudo-isomorphic to 'b'. So, we can remove either 'a' or 'b' from the set. We get {a,ab} or {b,ab}, hence 2.
Similarly, the first 3 characters are 'abb', the set is {a, ab, abb, b, bb} and as 'a' is pseudo-isomorphic to 'b', we have to remove either 'a' or 'b' from the set. We get {a,ab, abb, bb}, hence 4. and so on...",

When Alef is in any cell, he can randomly and with equal probability choose to move into one of the adjacent cells that don't contain an obstacle in it. If this cell contains a mine, the mine explodes and Alef dies. If this cell contains an exit, then Alef escapes the maze.
When Alef lands on a cell with an entrance to a
tunnel
, he is immediately transported through the tunnel and is thrown into the cell at the other end of the tunnel. Thereafter, he won't fall again, and will now randomly move to one of the adjacent cells again. (He could possibly fall in the same tunnel later.)
It's possible for Alef to get stuck in the maze in the case when the cell in which he was thrown into from a tunnel is surrounded by obstacles on all sides.

Kitties are Coming
edition. The game's rules are as follows:
The game starts with
stones that are randomly divided into
piles.
The cats move in alternating turns, and Little Cat always moves first.
During a move, a cat picks a pile having a number of stones
and splits it into any number of non-empty piles in the inclusive range from
to
.
The first cat to be unable to make a move (e.g., because all piles contain exactly
stone) loses the game.
Little Cat is curious about the number of ways in which the stones can be initially arranged so that she is guaranteed to win. Two arrangements of stone piles are considered to be different if they contain different sequences of values. For example, arrangements
and
are different.
Given the values for
,
, and

Note:
Each cat always moves
optimally
, meaning that they're both playing to win and neither cat will make a move that causes them to lose the game if some other (winning) sequence of moves can be made.

You will be able to sell only one blimp in each city you visit, but you do not need to visit every city, since some have expensive travel costs. Each city has an initial price that blimps sell for, but this goes down by a certain percentage as more blimps are sold (and the novelty wears off). Find a good route that will maximize profits.
Details
Blimp Decline
- The blimps will decline (
) in price every time you visit
of the cities (the number of cities will always be a multiple of
). For example, if
is
and there are
cities, then for every city you visit (except headquarters), the price of blimps will be multiplied by
. So after
visits, every city's blimp price will be about
of the initial value (
).
Note that if the price declines after you visit some city, then it will only happen
after
you made the sale on that city, so your sale on that city will not be affected. In particular, each blimp you sell in the first
of the cities will always be sold at their corresponding city's initial price.
Input Format
The first line of input for each test case will contain three parameters:
number of cities (

The salesman first travels a distance of √2 dollars to (1,1) carrying 2 blimps. This will cost him √2 dollars for his own travel and 6√2 dollars for the 2 blimps. He will then earn 30 dollars selling 1 blimp. He then continues to (2,2) with only 1 blimp, which will cost him 1√2 dollars for his travel and 3√2 dollars for his blimp. He will then earn 33.25 dollars selling the blimp, since the prices have declined by 5%. After his return to HQ (a distance of 2√2) he will have earned an approximate profit of 44.87 dollars.

Refer to the diagram in the challenge statement.",
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bomber-man?isFullScreen=true,"Bomberman
lives in a rectangular grid. Each cell in the grid either contains a bomb or nothing at all.
Each bomb can be planted in any cell of the grid but once planted, it will detonate after
exactly 3 seconds
. Once a bomb detonates, it's destroyed — along with anything in its four neighboring cells. This means that if a bomb detonates in cell
, any valid cells
and
are cleared. If there is a bomb in a neighboring cell, the neighboring bomb is destroyed
without
detonating, so there's no chain reaction.
Bomberman is immune to bombs, so he can move freely throughout the grid. Here's what he does:
Initially, Bomberman arbitrarily plants bombs in some of the cells, the initial state.
After one second, Bomberman does nothing.
After one more second, Bomberman plants bombs in all cells without bombs, thus filling the whole grid with bombs.  No bombs detonate at this point.
After one more second, any bombs planted exactly three seconds ago will detonate. Here, Bomberman stands back and observes.
Bomberman then repeats steps 3 and 4 indefinitely.
Note that during every second Bomberman plants bombs, the bombs are planted simultaneously (i.e.,
at the exact same moment
), and any bombs planted at the same time will detonate at the same time.
Given the initial configuration of the grid with the locations of Bomberman's first batch of planted bombs, determine the state of the grid after
seconds.
For example, if the initial grid looks like:
...
.
O
.
...
it looks the same after the first second.  After the second second, Bomberman has placed all his charges:
OOO
OOO
OOO
At the third second, the bomb in the middle blows up, emptying all surrounding cells:

But it's quite a long travel, so in the meantime they have started discussing about possible attacking plans. Right now, they're arguing about best ways for moving soldiers during the battle. Tired of not getting a final and concise strategy, Iroh proposed a particularly original idea.
Iroh:
Bumi, look at this map: here we have all possible locations in the battle field soldiers can occupy. I know a game which can give us some ideas.
Bumi:
A game? How will a game help us here?
Iroh:
It's pretty simple, we know which location is connected to each one, and also, that all those paths between locations are one-way (it's too dangerous to have two ways paths), so we place some soldiers at random initial locations, take turns, and in each turn, we try to make a valid move with one soldier from one location to another. Eventually, we won't be able to move any man so, the first one which is not able to perform any valid move, loses. One important thing is, at some moment, we may have some men at the same field location.
Bumi:
Are you sure we are gonna end this? We have so many locations and paths... don't know, soldiers could be moving in circles for ever.
Iroh:
Take it easy man, those paths were built by the best architects I've ever known, so there is no way that could happen.
Bumi:
Well, I still don't get how does this help us.
Iroh:
Me neither, but greatest generals from the Earth Kingdom created their strategies from this game, so, who knows?

Papyrus can buy the

Note that this is not the only valid solution; other valid solutions are acceptable.
He wants to buy exactly

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/stonegame?isFullScreen=true,"Alice and Bob are playing the game of
Nim
with
piles of stones with sizes
. If Alice plays first, she loses if and only if the '
xor
sum' (or 'Nim sum') of the piles is zero, i.e.,
.
Since Bob already knows who will win (assuming optimal play), he decides to cheat by removing some stones in some piles before the game starts. However, to reduce the risk of suspicion, he must keep at least one pile unchanged. Your task is to count the number of ways Bob can remove the stones to force Alice into losing the game. Since the number can be very large, output the number of ways
modulo
. Assume that both players will try to optimize their strategy and try to win the game.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains an integer
denoting the number of piles. The next line contains
space-separated integers
indicating the sizes of the stone piles.
