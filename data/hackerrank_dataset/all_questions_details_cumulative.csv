But if you don't want to use extra memory then you can manipulate the array instead. i.e. simulating exactly what the question says. Setting cell values to zero on the fly while iterating might lead to discrepancies. What if you use some other integer value as your marker?
There is still a better approach for this problem with O(1) space. We could have used 2 sets to keep a record of rows/columns which need to be set to zero. But for an O(1) space solution, you can use one of the rows and and one of the columns to keep track of this information. We can use the first cell of every row and column as a flag. This flag would determine whether a row or column has been set to zero.","289,2244,2259,2314","Game of Life,Number of Laser Beams in a Bank,Minimum Operations to Remove Adjacent Ones in Matrix,Remove All Ones With Row and Column Flips II"

The other line of thought is a tad bit complicated but essentially it builds on the idea of placing each element in its original position while keeping track of the element originally in that position.

Either there is no meeting room available and a new one has to be allocated, or a meeting room has freed up and this meeting can take place there. An important thing to note is that we don't really care which room gets freed up while allocating a room for the current meeting. As long as a room is free, our job is done. We already know the rooms we have allocated till now and we also know when are they due to get free because of the end times of the meetings going on in those rooms. We can simply check the room which is due to get vacated the earliest amongst all the allocated rooms. Following up on the previous hint, we can make use of a min-heap to store the end times of the meetings in various rooms. So, every time we want to check if any room is free or not, simply check the topmost element of the min heap as that would be the room that would get free the earliest out of all the other rooms currently occupied.

If the room we extracted from the top of the min heap isn't free, then no other room is. So, we can save time here and simply allocate a new room.","56,252,452,1184,2251,2402,2462,2848","Merge Intervals,Meeting Rooms,Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons,Car Pooling,Number of Flowers in Full Bloom,Meeting Rooms III,Total Cost to Hire K Workers,Points That Intersect With Cars"

Parentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically: Omitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.

A skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.

The Skiplist works this way: Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).
