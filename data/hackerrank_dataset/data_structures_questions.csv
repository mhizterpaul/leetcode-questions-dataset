In the first sequence, the maximum size increasing subsequence is 4, and there's only one of them. We choose
B = [(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 40)]

Of those, the one with the greatest weight is
B = [(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 50)]

Please note that this is not the maximum weight generated from picking the highest value element of each index. That value, 115, comes from [(1, 15), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 50)], which is not a valid subsequence because it cannot be created by only deleting elements in the original sequence.",

tree
consisting of
nodes and
edges. Each edge
has an integer weight,
.
Before the game starts, Andy chooses an unordered pair of distinct nodes,

to node
to construct a list of numbers. For example, in the diagram below, Andy constructs a list from the edge weights along the path
:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/0/1485795937-a90f0c2865-treegame_3_.png
Andy then uses this list to play the following game with Lily:
Two players move in alternating turns, and both players play optimally (meaning they will not make a move that causes them to lose the game if some better, winning move exists).
Andy always starts the game by removing a single integer from the list.
During each subsequent move, the current player removes an integer
less than or equal to
the integer removed in the last move.
The first player to be unable to move loses the game.
For example, if the list of integers is
and Andy starts the game by removing
, the list becomes
. Then, in Lily's move, she must remove a remaining integer less than or equal to

It can be empty (null).
It contains a root node only.
It contains a root node with a left subtree, a right subtree, or both. These subtrees are also binary trees.
In-order
traversal is performed as
Traverse the left subtree.
Visit root.
Traverse the right subtree.
For this in-order traversal, start from the left child of the root node and keep exploring the left subtree until you reach a leaf.  When you reach a leaf, back up to its parent, check for a right child and visit it if there is one.  If there is not a child, you've explored its left and right subtrees fully. If there is a right child, traverse its left subtree then its right in the same manner.  Keep doing this until you have traversed the entire tree.  You will only store the values of a node as you visit when one of the following is true:
it is the first node visited, the first time visited
it is a leaf, should only be visited once
all of its subtrees have been explored, should only be visited once while this is true
it is the root of the tree, the first time visited
Swapping:
Swapping subtrees of a node means that if initially node has left subtree
L
and right subtree
R

R

queue
is an abstract data type that maintains the order in which elements were added to it, allowing the oldest elements to be removed from the front and new elements to be added to the rear. This is called a
First-In-First-Out
(FIFO) data structure because the first element added to the queue (i.e., the one that has been waiting the longest) is always the first one to be removed.
A basic queue has the following operations:
Enqueue
: add a new element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue
: remove the element from the front of the queue and return it.
In this challenge, you must first implement a queue using
two stacks
. Then process
queries, where each query is one of the following
types:
1 x
: Enqueue element
into the end of the queue.
2
: Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
3

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer,
, denoting the number of queries.
Each line
of the
subsequent lines contains a single query in the form described in the problem statement above. All three queries start with an integer denoting the query
, but only query

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/self-balancing-tree?isFullScreen=true,"An AVL tree (Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis' tree, named after the inventors) is a self-balancing binary search tree.  In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.
We define balance factor for each node as :
balanceFactor = height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)
The balance factor of any node of an AVL tree is in the integer range [-1,+1]. If after any modification in the tree, the balance factor becomes less than −1 or greater than +1, the subtree rooted at this node is unbalanced, and a rotation is needed.

(
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree
)
You are given a pointer to the root of an AVL tree. You need to insert a value into this tree and perform the necessary rotations to ensure that it remains balanced.
Input Format
You are given a function,
node *insert(node * root,int new_val)
{


}
'node' is defined as :
struct node
{
int val;            //value
struct node* left;  //left child
struct node* right; //right child
int ht;             //height of the node
} node;
You only need to complete the function.
Note: All the values in the tree will be distinct. Height of a Null node is -1 and the height of the leaf node is 0.

Explanation
After inserting 6 in the tree. the tree becomes:

Balance Factor of nodes 3 and 4 is no longer in the range [-1,1]. We need to perform a rotation to balance the tree. This is the right right case. We perform a single rotation to balance the tree.
After performing the rotation, the tree becomes :

Like every IT company, the Uplink Corporation has its own network. But, unlike the rest of the companies around the world, Uplink's network is subject to very specific restrictions:
Any pair of servers within the network should be directly connected by at most 1 link.
Each link is controlled by some specific network administrator.
No server has more than 2 links connected to it, that are controlled by the same administrator.
For easier management, links controlled by some administrator cannot be redundant (this is, removing any link will disconnect some two previously connected servers)
Notice that 2 connected servers might not have any direct link between them. Furthermore, in order to keep the network in a secured status, Uplink directives periodically try to perform some modifications over the network to mislead hackers. The problem is, having such a huge network, they need a software to efficiently simulate the network status after any of such modifications. You have been assigned to write the core section of that software.
Operations performed by the directives are:
Change the administrator assigned to some particular link.
Place some number of security devices along a particular link.
Also, given a network administrator, they would like to know how many devices are in the path created by links controlled by that administrator (if any) between 2 servers.
Input Format

separated by a single whitespace, denoting the number of servers, links, network administrators and transformations, respectively.

meaning that link between server
and server
is requested to be assigned to administrator
meaning that the number of security devices along the link between server
and server
will be fixed to
, removing any existing devices on this link before the operation. The involved link will always exist.
meaning that directives want to know the number of security devices placed along the path between server
and server

Initially elements are placed like this:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
after the first rotation, they are placed like this:
[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
and that's how we get the first 2 results (first 2 lines in the output). After second rotation, they are placed like this:
[3, 2, 5, 4, 1]
and third one does this:
[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]
In the last rotation (1 5 5), it's easy to see that output matches the initial positions of the elements. Last rotation doesn't change the positions of the elements.",

While in a normal restaurant, a customer is served by following the first-come, first-served rule, Tieu simply minimizes the average waiting time of his customers. So he gets to decide who is served first, regardless of how sooner or later a person comes.
Different kinds of pizzas take different amounts of time to cook. Also, once he starts cooking a pizza, he cannot cook another pizza until the first pizza is completely cooked. Let's say we have three customers who come at time t=0, t=1, & t=2 respectively, and the time needed to cook their pizzas is 3, 9, & 6 respectively. If Tieu applies first-come, first-served rule, then the waiting time of three customers is 3, 11, & 16  respectively. The average waiting time in this case is (3 + 11 + 16) / 3 = 10. This is not an optimized solution. After serving the first customer at time t=3, Tieu can choose to serve the third customer. In that case, the waiting time will be 3, 7, & 17 respectively. Hence the average waiting time is (3 + 7 + 17) / 3 = 9.

(2,3,4) is one such triplet because on all paths i.e 2 to 3, 3 to 4 and 2 to 4 there is atleast one edge having red color.
(2,3,5), (1,3,4) and (1,3,5) are other such triplets.
Note that (1,2,3) is NOT a triplet, because the path from 1 to 2 does not have an edge with red color.",
