But if you don't want to use extra memory then you can manipulate the array instead. i.e. simulating exactly what the question says. Setting cell values to zero on the fly while iterating might lead to discrepancies. What if you use some other integer value as your marker?
There is still a better approach for this problem with O(1) space. We could have used 2 sets to keep a record of rows/columns which need to be set to zero. But for an O(1) space solution, you can use one of the rows and and one of the columns to keep track of this information. We can use the first cell of every row and column as a flag. This flag would determine whether a row or column has been set to zero.","289,2244,2259,2314","Game of Life,Number of Laser Beams in a Bank,Minimum Operations to Remove Adjacent Ones in Matrix,Remove All Ones With Row and Column Flips II"

Either there is no meeting room available and a new one has to be allocated, or a meeting room has freed up and this meeting can take place there. An important thing to note is that we don't really care which room gets freed up while allocating a room for the current meeting. As long as a room is free, our job is done. We already know the rooms we have allocated till now and we also know when are they due to get free because of the end times of the meetings going on in those rooms. We can simply check the room which is due to get vacated the earliest amongst all the allocated rooms. Following up on the previous hint, we can make use of a min-heap to store the end times of the meetings in various rooms. So, every time we want to check if any room is free or not, simply check the topmost element of the min heap as that would be the room that would get free the earliest out of all the other rooms currently occupied.

If the room we extracted from the top of the min heap isn't free, then no other room is. So, we can save time here and simply allocate a new room.","56,252,452,1184,2251,2402,2462,2848","Merge Intervals,Meeting Rooms,Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons,Car Pooling,Number of Flowers in Full Bloom,Meeting Rooms III,Total Cost to Hire K Workers,Points That Intersect With Cars"

Parentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically: Omitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.

We can use a similar approach as an optimization to avoid repeated sorting. Employ two heaps: left heap and right heap. The left heap is a max-heap, and the right heap is a min-heap. The size of the left heap is k + 1 (best locations), where k is the number of times the get method was invoked. The other locations are maintained in the right heap. Every time when add is being called, we add it to the left heap. If the size of the left heap exceeds k + 1, we move the head element to the right heap. When the get method is invoked again (the k + 1 time it is invoked), we can return the head element of the left heap. But before returning it, if the right heap is not empty, we maintain the left heap to have the best k + 2 items by moving the best location from the right heap to the left heap.","295,789,1953","Find Median from Data Stream,Kth Largest Element in a Stream,Finding MK Average"

The weighted median node is defined as the first node x on the path from ui to vi such that the sum of edge weights from ui to x is greater than or equal to half of the total path weight. You are given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[j] = [uj, vj], determine the weighted median node along the path from uj to vj. Return an array ans, where ans[j] is the node index of the weighted median for queries[j]. ",Hard,21.6,13309,2871,None,49,5,"Use binary lifting and lowest common ancestor. Let the query nodes be u and v, with lowest common ancestor l and total path weight tot. If the median lies on the path from u up to l: find the first node where 2 * sum >= tot (equivalently, the last where 2 * sum < tot and move one node above). Otherwise, it lies on the path from v up to l: use the same 2 * sum >= tot criterion as you climb. In both cases, binary lifting with sparse tables lets you jump by powers of two while tracking cumulative weights to locate the weighted median in O(log n)",,
